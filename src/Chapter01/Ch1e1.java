     * 1. In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a
     comment?
     A statement is a line of code that performs a basic
     operation. (Part of a program that specifies one step of an algorithm.)
     Comment is a bit of English text that explains the code. (A part of a program that contains information about the program
     but has no effect when the program runs.)

     2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
     High-level languages are portable, meaning they can run on different
     kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs
     can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run
     on another.

     3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?
     To translate a program in a high-level language into a low-level
     language, all at once, in preparation for later execution.

     4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
     To translate a program in a high-level language into a low-level
     language, all at once, in preparation for later execution.
